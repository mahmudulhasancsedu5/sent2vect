'Blade runner' Pistorius charged with murder of model girlfriend - CNN0com
Pretoria, South Africa A beloved model is dead, those who knew her are in mourning, and one of the world's most admired Olympians is charged with her murder after a Valentine's Day shooting in South Africa1
Oscar Pistorius, a Paralympic runner who blazed new terrain by competing in last summer's Olympics, is accused of killing his girlfriend, Reeva Steenkamp2
A shooting took place inside his upscale home in Pretoria, South Africa, early Thursday, and only the two of them were there at the time, police said3
Shock waves from the incident quickly reverberated across the world, casting a shadow over the man known as the "Blade Runner" for his achievements on prosthetic limbs4
Pistorius will be named officially as the suspect when he appears in court Friday, in keeping with South African law5
Authorities have already announced that the suspect is Pistorius' age6
Investigators gave no motive for the alleged killing7

"Previous incidents" at the home, police say
Police were alerted to the shooting by neighbors, and residents had "heard things earlier," spokeswoman Denise Beukes said8
A police spokeswoman said there had been "previous incidents" at the home, including "allegations of a domestic nature9"
They did not detail what those may be10
Pistorius was arrested and accused of common assault in 2009, but the case was thrown out because of a lack of evidence, police told CNN on Thursday11
That incident involved Pistorius allegedly slamming a door during a party, and a piece of the door fell off and hit someone, said Capt12
Marissa Van der Merwe of South African police13
Police are not aware of any prior incidents between Pistorius and Steenkamp, Van der Merwe said14
Some South African media outlets suggested Pistorius may have mistaken Steenkamp for an intruder15
South Africa has a high crime rate, and many homeowners keep weapons to ward off intruders16
Beukes said those reports did not come from police17
There did not appear to be signs of forced entry at the home, she added18
"This is a very quiet area, and this is a secure estate," Beukes said19
A pistol was recovered at the scene, police said20
In November 2011, Pistorius tweeted a photo of himself at a gun range, and wrote that he had "a 96% headshot over 300m from 50 shots!
Bam!"
Pistorius cooperating with police
Pistorius has made no public statement21
His spokeswoman Kate Silvers said the athlete is "assisting the police with their investigation but there will be no further comment until matters become clearer later today22"
Police also said Pistorius is cooperating23
He arrived Thursday at a police station in Pretoria24
Beukes said the state will oppose bail25
That means the 26-year-old, who was among the men featured in People magazine's "Sexiest Man Alive" issue, could be behind bars, at least temporarily26
Pistorius is not being brought to court Thursday because the public prosecutor needs more time to prepare the case, police spokeswoman Katlego Mogale told CNN27
A model's life violently cut short
Steenkamp, 29, had been looking forward to Valentine's Day, encouraging her Twitter followers to "get excited" for the holiday28
On Wednesday, she tweeted, "It's a beautiful day!
Make things happen29
Starting my day off with a yummy healthy shake from my boo," followed by a smiley face30
"Boo" is a term for boyfriend31
"She was the kindest, sweetest human being; an angel on earth and will be sorely missed," Capacity Relations, the agency that represented her, wrote on Twitter32
She was "just a great, fun presence of a person," said Hagen Engler, former editor of the magazine FHM33
He described her as "a bikini model, beautiful, gorgeous girl" with a "wicked" sense of humor34
She understood the industry and was intelligent and fun to work with, he said35
Pistorius' father, Henke, told the South African Broadcasting Corp36 his son was "sad at the moment37"
"I don't know nothing38
It will be extremely obnoxious and rude to speculate," the father said39
"I don't know the facts40"
Nike pulls ad
Nike pulled an ad featuring Pistorius from its website Thursday41
The ad showed Pistorius taking off for a run, and contained the words" I am the bullet in the chamber42"
The company issued a statement expressing "sympathy and condolences to the families concerned following this tragic incident43"
The company added that it will not comment further, noting that the situation is a police matter44
Other Pistorius sponsors -- including prosthetics manufacturer Ossur, British Telecom, and Oakley, which makes sunglasses and other products -- expressed condolences and said they had no further comment at this time45
Fashion company Thierry Mugler had no comment46
As Olympian, Pistorius faced controversy
Pistorius, a double amputee, competed against able-bodied runners during the London Olympics, triggering controversy as some said the prosthetic limbs gave him an advantage47
His legs were amputated below the knee when he was a toddler because of a bone defect48
He runs on special carbon fiber blades49
Pistorius was initially refused permission to enter the Olympics, but he hired a legal team to prove that his artificial limbs did not give him an unfair advantage -- and was allowed to compete50
While he did not win a medal, his presence on the track was lauded by many people around the world as an example of victory over adversity and dedication to a goal51
He smashed a Paralympic record to win the men's 400m T44 in the final athletics event of the 2012 Games52
In an October interview with CNN's "Piers Morgan Tonight," Pistorius discussed the "massive blessing" of inspiring people around the world53
"Being an international sportsman, there's a lot of responsibility that comes with that, so having to toggle that and remembering, you know, that there are kids out there, especially, that look up to you -- it's definitely something that you need to keep at the back of your mind54"
